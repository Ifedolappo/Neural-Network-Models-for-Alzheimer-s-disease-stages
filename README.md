Diagnoses and treatments for neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease are extremely difficult (Dokholyan, Mohs and Bateman, 2022; Shusharina et al., 2023). Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans are now useful instruments for the early diagnosis and categorization of Alzheimer's disease because to developments in medical imaging technology (Aramadaka et al., 2023). In this work, we make use of an MRI scan dataset from individuals with Alzheimer's disease who were divided into four groups: Very Mild Demented, Moderately Demented, NonDemented, and Mildly Demented.

Our main goal is to create and evaluate neural network models that can accurately classify Alzheimer's disease stages using MRI scan data. In order to begin this trip, we build two fundamental neural networks: a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a simple neural network. These baseline models provide us with a basis for comparing them to their enhanced equivalents.

In addition, we present two enhanced neural network topologies, acknowledging the need for model improvement to attain better performance. One is an upgraded Convolutional Neural Network, and the other is an enhanced Simple Neural Network. These improved models include structural changes as well as tweaks to the training process designed to improve classification robustness and accuracy.

We hope to clarify the effectiveness of the suggested enhancements and identify the influence of architectural modifications on neural network classification performance in identifying Alzheimer's disease stages from MRI images through this comparative investigation. These discoveries have the potential to improve Alzheimer's disease diagnosis techniques and aid in the creation of better medical decision support systems.
